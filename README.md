🌐 Personal Portfolio

Hey there — this is my personal portfolio website. It’s where I showcase my projects, skills, and a bit about who I am as a developer. The goal was to build something clean, fast, and easy to update as I keep improving.
🚀 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- React (for components and routing)

- Git & GitHub for version control

- Vite (or Create React App, if you used that) for setup and build

- Deployed on bejewelled-crostata-952167.netlify.app

🎨 Features
